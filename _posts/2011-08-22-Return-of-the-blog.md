With the good intent to bring this blog to new life, I migrated after 7 years 
[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) blogging to a new blogging 
platform: 

![Jekyll logo](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/203791/www/jekyll.png)

**[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the blogging 
engine that makes you [blog like a hacker](http://goo.gl/VbHzq)**.

Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator. That means, that I don't need 
any database engine and no more PHP for dynamic pages. I can simply generate 
this site on my local machine and then host it on Amazons S3 storage. 
A static solution may first seem old fashioned, but if you think about it 
you will see that Javascript heavy pages that shift the processing from server
to the client browser are the [future](http://goo.gl/I0AVf).

Let's see how this works out.
