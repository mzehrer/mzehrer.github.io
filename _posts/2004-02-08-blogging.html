I don't know if I like blogging (fun to write this in my blog), but reading blogs is really time consuming. I configured <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">straw</a> and tried to follow Planet Gnome and Planet Debian on a regular basis. But it's to much (40+ entries everyday in each of these blogs). I think I need some kind of blog-content-filter. 

But it seems that I'm <a href="http://ganneff.de/blog/2004/02/07#planet">not the only one</a>.

Maybe <a href="http://read4me.sourceforge.net/">this</a> is a solution...
