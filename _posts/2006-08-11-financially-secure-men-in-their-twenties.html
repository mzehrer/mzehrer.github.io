See what <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/10/traffic-fight-hitwise-says-delicious-is-soaring/">this article</a> tells us about del.icio.us users:

<em>The one thing that’s easy to believe is Hitwise’s demographic data: social bookmarking traffic is still very small and dominated by financially secure men in their twenties. Much of the world is still unserved by this very useful class of tools.</em>

I feel flattered...
