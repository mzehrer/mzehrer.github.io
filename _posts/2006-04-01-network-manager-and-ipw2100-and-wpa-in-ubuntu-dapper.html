To get wpa and the ipw2100 working with the latest Network Manager in Ubuntu Dapper, which finally supports wpa, you will have to update manually the drivers for ieee80211 to version 1.1.12 and ipw2100 to version 1.2.1.

I followed this <a href="http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Network_Manager_with_WPA#IPW2100_chipset">HowTo</a>  (just the part with these two drivers, everything else is already included with Dapper)
