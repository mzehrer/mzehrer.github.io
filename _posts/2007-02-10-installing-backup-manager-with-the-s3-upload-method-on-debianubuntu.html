<p><a href="http://www.backup-manager.org/"><strong>backup-manager</strong></a> is a simple and straightforward backup solution and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com"><strong>Amazon S3</strong></a> gives you reliable remote storage. </p>

<p>Since the backup-manager versions in Debian and Ubuntu are little bit outdated, I would recommend installing the 0.7.5 Release from the <a href="http://www.backup-manager.org/download/">Website</a>.  While the installation of backup-manager is painless, getting the s3 part running a little bit tricky (and undocumented).<br /> The s3 part of backup-manager is based on the  Net::Amazon::S3 perl module and this needs the XML::LibXML::XPathContext module, which is, as far as I can see, not included in one of the libxml-*-perl packages in Debian or Ubuntu.</p> 
<p>So, this procedure gives you all the needed dependencies:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install libperl6-slurp-perl libxml2-dev
sudo cpan XML::LibXML
sudo cpan Net::Amazon::S3
</pre>

<p>
 <em><b>Update:</b> (14.06.07) Ubuntu feisty now contains the 7.5.3 version of backup-manager.</em>
</p>
