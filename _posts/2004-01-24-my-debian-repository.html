It seems that nearly every piece of software has also a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">Debian package</a>, but from time to time there is a program that is not (yet) packaged. So I set up a little repository where I will put packages of software which are  important for me but can't be found in the offical repository. 

Put this in your sources.list to get the packages:

<pre>
deb http://www.zepan.org/debian binary/
deb-src http://www.zepan.org/debian source/
</pre>

Btw.: I'm also maintaing a package in the offical Debian  repository: <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/oops">oops</a> .
