I created a <a href="http://www.zepan.org/gnomeonwin32/">page</a> for a link collection of GTK+ and Gnome projects that support the Win32 platform. This includes applications and also development stuff.  If you are forced to use Windows on work, it's sometimes nice to have one of your Gnome friends with you. Please mail me if you have any additions.
