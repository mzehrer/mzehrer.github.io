Since it seems that there are no sound patches for the <a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">TiMidity</a> MIDI to WAVE converter in the Debian archives, I packaged a nice collection of patches by Eric A. Welsh into the  timidity-eaw-patches package and added it to <a href="http://www.zepan.org/debian/">my Debian repository</a>.
