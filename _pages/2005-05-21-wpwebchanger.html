<p>On <a href="http://taint.org/xplanet/">this site</a> you can download<em> "a selection of desktop-sized high-quality PNG images, using near-real-time cloud data, and some very nicely rendered maps using satellite data, to create a nifty, nearly-live world map desktop background"</em>.</p>
<p><div align="center"><img src="http://taint.org/xplanet/title.png" alt="xplanet image" /></div></p>
<p>Since these are png images you will need to convert them to bmp to use them as wallpapers (you could also convert to jpg, but then you need the <em>Active Desktop</em> feature).  So I wrote a little command line program that downloads a picture from the web, converts it and then changes your Desktop. Combine this with your favourite scheduler and enjoy the "Nearly-Live Planetary Desktop".</p>
